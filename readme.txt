Warn your readers of potentially traumatic content.

== Description ==

A trauma trigger is an experience that triggers a traumatic memory in someone who has experienced trauma. A trigger is thus a troubling reminder of a traumatic event, although the trigger itself
need not be frightening or traumatic.

Trigger Warning Deluxe is a great way of giving your readers a heads up in what to expect in articles containing potential triggers.
