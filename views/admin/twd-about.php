Trigger Warning Deluxe is a great way of giving your readers a heads up in what to expect in articles containing potential triggers.

<blockquote>
Triggers can be quite diverse, appearing in the form of individual people, places, noises, images, smells, tastes, emotions, animals, films, scenes within films, dates of the year,
tones of voice, body positions, bodily sensations, weather conditions, time factors, or combinations thereof. Triggers can be subtle and difficult to anticipate, and can sometimes
exacerbate post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition in which sufferers cannot control the recurrence of emotional or physical symptoms, or of repressed memory.
A trauma trigger may also be referred to as a trauma stimulus or a trauma stressor.
